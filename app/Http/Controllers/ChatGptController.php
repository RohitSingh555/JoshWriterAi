        Objective:
        Generate variations of a provided product description, encode them for URL use, and construct a search URL for the Facebook Ads Library.

        Task: Generate 3 variations of the product description, each in 1-2 words. Aim for variations that capture different aspects or keywords relevant to the product.
        Output: Present the five variations to the user.
        Example:
        Input: 'organic coffee'
        Output Variations:
        'Eco-friendly coffee'
        'Organic brew'
        'Natural coffee'
        'Sustainable coffee'
        'Green coffee'

        Step 2: Encode Descriptions for URL Use
        Input: Take each product description variation.
        Task: Encode the descriptions for URL compatibility, replacing spaces with %20 and encoding special characters as necessary.
        Output: Provide the encoded descriptions.

        Step 3: Insert Encoded Description into Template URL
        Input: Use the base template URL for the Facebook Ads Library search:
        python
        Copy code
        https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&ad_type=all&country=US&q=[input]&sort_data[direction]=desc&sort_data[mode]=relevancy_monthly_grouped&search_type=keyword_unordered&media_type=all
        Task: For each encoded product description, replace [input] in the template URL with the encoded description.
        Output: Generate the complete URLs for each variation.

        Step 4: URL Testing Guidance
        Task: Instruct the user to test each URL by copying and pasting it into their web browser's address bar and pressing Enter, to verify it directs to the intended Facebook Ads Library search results.
